The codes were written at Ariel University's TEST (Thermal Energy Science & Technology) laboratory, headed by Dr. Tzabar Nir, who is also the headÂ of the Center for Energy Research in Ariel University.
The authors would like to express their gratitude to Ariel University for providing a generous Rector's Scholarship for Academic Excellence to conduct the research.
To run the algorithms, look for scripts with a name that ends in "main".
